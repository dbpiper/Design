1  Use the task flow diagrams and the user flow diagrams to create low-fidelity
   wireframes for each of the screens which are likely to be needed, as identified
   in the structure phase.
   • The purpose of this is to get as many ideas out there as possible for the
     screens. There should be at least 5+ low-fidelity wireframes created for
     each screen. These should be done on paper with a pen/pencil, **not digitally!**
   • On each screen, you should star each of the wireframes that you like and
     want to investigate further. This helps to narrow-down the ideas to just
     a few good ones.
2  Use the low-fidelity wireframes to create medium-fidelity wireframe for each
   screen. 
    • This should be done digitally, in a UI design tool like: Figma, Sketch, or
      Adobe XD.
    • These should not have final color, or copy. They should mostly just
      use something like ---------- for the text (that is a rectangle instead of
      typography). This avoids problems like focusing on the typography and copy.
    • There should be no color, only value. In other words, everything should
      be grayscale.
    • A few medium-fidelity wireframes may be created for some screens. You should
      create one based on the low-fidelity wireframe for the screen that you like
      the most. If you don't end up liking the idea still, after it is rendered
      at medium-fidelity, then you can try another one. Keep doing this until
      you have a medium-fidelity wireframe for the screen that you are proud
      of and would like to render to high-fidelity.
    •  This stage is important as it can be used to render to the user on the
       final product as a sort of "loading" object. That is, you can show generic
       icons and rectangles from this stage instead of the real icons and text
       until it is done loading. I have observed this technique being used all
       over the web including on YouTube.
3  Use the medium-fidelity wireframe to create a high-fidelity wireframe.
   • Take the medium-fidelity wireframe and add in typography, and copy to some
     degree. It should not be as "fully-rendered" as the final UI Mockup, however
     it _should_ have real copy or at least lorem ipsum.

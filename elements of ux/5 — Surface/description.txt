• UI Mockup
• UI Motion Design

1  Use the High-fidelity Wireframe created as part of the Skeleton phase to
   create the UI mock-up.
   • This represents the specification. That is it is the digital version
     of a blueprint; the finished product should match it exactly! In other
     words, this is the object which represents the requirements and the
     way they will be satisfied.
2  Create any needed UI Motion Design.
   • See the book "Designing Interface Animaion" by Val Head for more information.
   • These should be in the form of MP4 files.
   • These should be accompanied by documentation
     ◦ See especially Chapters 10 and 11.
     ◦ The purpose of the animation. What is it telling the user?
     ◦ Building Blocks:
        • Opacity
        • Scale
        • Color
        • Depth
        • Position
        • Rotation
        • Blur
    ◦ Duration of each animation
    ◦ The easing equation used for each animation
    ◦ Any delay values used for each animation
    ◦ Any repeat values or iteration counts for the animaion

• Concept Map
• Task Flow Diagrams
• User Flow Diagrams



1. Organize User Stories/Requirements into a mind map
    • Related concepts should be grouped together, as they might either be on
      the same screen or be linked together (you click on one to get to the other).
2. Organize the Mind Map into a Concept Map by making structural decisions
    • For example: should an item be in the navbar, bottom drawer, header, footer,
                   main content section, etc.
3. Arrage the concept map into task flow diagrams
    • A high-level view of a task; generally just which pages are visited or basic actions.
    • Common to all users, rather than specific to certain types of them.
4. Make user flow diagrams using the: task flow diagrams, concept maps, user needs, user personas,
   and user needs.
    • The user flow diagrams represent complex user interactions.
    • Specific to certain user types/personas.

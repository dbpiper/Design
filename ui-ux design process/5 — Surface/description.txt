• Organized Wireframe
• UI Mockup
• UI Motion Design


1  Create the Organized Wireframe by carefully analyzing the High-fidelity
   Wireframe and organizing it into Figma components (or equivalent in the
   relevant software) and putting those into screens/frames for each of the
   pieces of Atomic design (Atoms, Molecules, etc.). 
     
    • I have decided to splint this up as I noticed that before I could work on
    the UI design part of the Mockup I had to go through and carefully
    organize everything first. This is because I let the Wireframe/Skeleton
    process be very free-form and messy in-exchange for much more creativity
    and a better layout overall.
        
2  Use the Organized Wireframe to begin creating the UI Mockup.
   • This represents the specification. That is it is the digital version
     of a blueprint; the finished product should match it exactly! In other
     words, this is the object which expresses the requirements and the
     way they will be satisfied.
  
3  Create any needed UI Motion Design.
   • See the book "Designing Interface Animaion" by Val Head for more information.
   • These should be in the form of MP4 files _and_ GIF files.
   • These should be accompanied by documentation
     ◦ See especially Chapters 10 and 11.
     ◦ The purpose of the animation. What is it telling the user?
     ◦ Building Blocks:
        • Opacity
        • Scale
        • Color
        • Depth
        • Position
        • Rotation
        • Blur
    ◦ Duration of each animation
    ◦ The easing equation used for each animation
    ◦ Any delay values used for each animation
    ◦ Any repeat values or iteration counts for the animaion

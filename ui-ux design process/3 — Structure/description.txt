• Interaction Map



1. Make a Requirements Map by organizing User Stories/Requirements into a mind map
    • Related concepts should be grouped together, as they might either be on
      the same screen.
2. Make an Interaction Map if the project is very dynamic and has many interactions
   else if the project is very static (like a portfolio) then make a Site map or App map
   based on the user stories map.
3. Make task flow diagrams for the main tasks to ensure that the flow of the
   interaction map is good.
    • A high-level view of a task; generally just which pages are visited or basic actions.
    • Common to all users, rather than specific to certain types of them.
    • This can be prototyped simply using a similar method to the low-fidelity
      wireframe, where different ideas are sketched out and the best chosen.
4. As needed, make user flow diagrams for any task flows that "seem too long",
   in order to try to find ways to simplify them.
    • The user flow diagrams represent complex user interactions.
    • Specific to certain user types/personas.
    • Used to find problems with the flow of the site and tasks.

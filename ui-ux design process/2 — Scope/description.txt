• Requirements
• User Stories
• User Scenarios

1. Write out some User Scenarios based on the jobs to be done.
    • Make some mini-User Personas for these, which helps to add personality
      to the user scenarios. Each should have:
        ◦ A photo (https://www.pexels.com is great)
        ◦ A job title/profession or user role
        ◦ A name (https://www.behindthename.com/random/ is great)
2. Make User Stories based on User Scenarios
3. Analyze User Stories and augment them with acceptance tests.
    • Create acceptance tests for the stories
        Should:
            ◦ Impose a decision on the implementation
            ◦ Decide on the context of the user story
              • For example: is "Mary had a little lamb" about eating lamb or a nursery rhyme?
4. Rank/Prioritize the User Stories (MoSCoW)

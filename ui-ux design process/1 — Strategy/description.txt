• Identify user needs.
• What is the purpose of the project, what value is it providing?
• Who are the users?
• How can we improve their lives with our project?
• Jobs-to-be-done Theory (JTBD)
• Job/Outcome Story Template

1  Create a mind map to brainstorm and figure out:
    • Who the users might be?
    • Why they want to use the product?
    • Where would it work best: mobile, desktop, tablet, watch, etc.?
    • What is the core functionality that will be provided; value proposition?
    • Keep asking why at each stage. Why are they wanting to use your application,
      why do they want to do what they want to do with the application, etc.
2  Create Job/Outcome Story Templates using the information from the mind map
    • Create one of these for each possible job which can be done with the
      product. Ideally there should be as many as possible, at least a handful.
